      We want to use our knowledge to create a competitive edge for as many people as possible. In various industries,
      we create easy access to the topics surrounding digital transformation. Because for us, digitization is much more
      than just technology; it starts with digital culture, puts business models to the test, and generates innovations.
      In the process, we also take on operational, digital services for our customers; worldwide from North America to
      Southeast Asia! On this page you will find current examples of how we work with our customers.

            NUCIDA helps companies with the digital transformation of their business processes. By combining visual
            modeling and descriptions of the processes including their workflows, we increase transparency and
            standardization. The additional model validation proves the improvements achieved through this. Together
            with the business units concerned, we reduce frictional losses and waste of resources.

            We at BMW Group rely heavily on enterprise-ready, robust and mature software. After evaluating some
            competitors over a longer time we finally decided for Xray. This high-quality software supports agile
            development processes very well, integrates smoothly into Jira and proves to be the missing part for testing
            in Jira in any aspect.

            NUCIDA brought our engineers back to using a centralized tool for their test execution and specification.
            Xray has a very simple UI and a great API, so folks need only a couple of minutes to get used to it, without
            any training necessary. The team always has an open ear for feature requests and a quick reaction on bug
            fixes.

            The support service so heart-warming it almost melts you. Seriously, the questions I addressed were pretty
            hardcore but every item was resolved with a very detailed answer. After some ideas of mine, even an
            improvement report was created - looking forward to working with you guys.
